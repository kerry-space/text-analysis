* $> curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -X POST -d "Banan Ã„pple Katt Hund Banan Hund Katt Hund" http://localhost:8080/count
- The command includes
- the header "-H 'Content-Type: text/plain'" which specifies that the data being sent is in plain text format.
- The header "-X POST" specifies that this is a POST request.
-  The option "-d" specifies the data to be sent in the request body.
#### This will return a JSON object with the top 10 most frequent words and their frequencies:
